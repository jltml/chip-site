        Michael Fisher's (co-founder) nephew has kidney necrosis. Despite his disability, TJ is unstoppable. He learned to walk before learning to crawl. It's a shame that he spends hours every week in the car traveling to receive infusions. CHIP offers the same hospital quality care in the comfort of home. We deliver your child's medication and compact equipment directly to you. CHIP provides a local and convenient choice for your infusion needs so that children with medical complexities, like TJ, can be happy at home with family.
